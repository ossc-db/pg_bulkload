# postgresql-- a wrapper script of pg_ctl
#
#    - NOTE: If you use pg_bulkload, you must use this script instead of pg_ctl.
#      + This script calls our own recovery process solving clash while data is
#        loaded with pg_bulkload.
#
#    - You can give all of the pg_ctl options to this script.
#    - If given command to PostgreSQL is not start or restart,
#      this script doesn't execute pg_bulkload's recovery and call pg_ctl 
#      directory.

$CMDNAME is a utility to start pg_bulkload -r and to start, stop, restart,
reload configuration files, report the status of a PostgreSQL server, 
or signal a PostgreSQL process.

Usage:
  $CMDNAME start   [-w] [-D DATADIR]  [-l FILENAME] [-o \"OPTIONS\"]
  $CMDNAME stop    [-W] [-D DATADIR]  [-m SHUTDOWN-MODE]
  $CMDNAME restart [-w] [-D DATADIR]  [-m SHUTDOWN-MODE] [-o \"OPTIONS\"]
  $CMDNAME reload  [-D DATADIR] 
  $CMDNAME status  [-D DATADIR]
  $CMDNAME kill    SIGNALNAME PID

Common options:
  -D, --pgdata DATADIR   location of the database storage area
  -w                     wait until operation completes
  -W                     do not wait until operation completes
  --help                 show this help, then exit
  --version              output version information, then exit
(The default is to wait for shutdown, but not for start or restart.)

If the -D option is omitted, the environment variable PGDATA is used.

Options for start or restart:
  -l, --log FILENAME     write (or append) server log to FILENAME
  -o OPTIONS             command line options to pass to postgres
                         (PostgreSQL server executable)
  -p PATH-TO-POSTGRES    normally not necessary

Options for stop or restart:
  -m SHUTDOWN-MODE   may be \"smart\", \"fast\", or \"immediate\"

Shutdown modes are:
  smart       quit after all clients have disconnected
  fast        quit directly, with proper shutdown
  immediate   quit without complete shutdown; will lead to recovery on restart

Allowed signal names for kill:
  HUP INT QUIT ABRT TERM USR1 USR2"
